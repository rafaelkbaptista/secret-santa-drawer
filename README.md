# Secret Santa Drawer
This is a simple and fun project developed to make organizing Secret Santa drawings easier. The application allows users to add participants' names to a list and, with a single click, perform the draw to find out who the secret friend is.

## Main Features
* Add Names: The user can enter a participant's name in the text field and click the "Add" button to include them in the draw list.

* List View: All added names are displayed in a list on the screen, allowing the user to see who is already participating.

## Input Validation:

* The system does not allow empty names to be added.

* It prevents the inclusion of duplicate names, ensuring that each participant is unique.

* Random Draw: By clicking the "Sortear Amigo" (Draw Friend) button, the application randomly selects a name from the list of participants.

* Result Display: The name of the drawn secret friend is displayed prominently on the screen.

## How to Use
* Open the index.html file in your preferred browser.

* Type a participant's name in the text field and click Add.

* Repeat the process for all participants.

* When all names are on the list, click the Sortear Amigo button.

* The result of the draw will appear just below the list of names.

## Technologies Used
* HTML5: For the page structure.

* CSS3: For styling and responsive design.

* JavaScript: For all functional logic, including DOM manipulation, validations, and the random draw.
